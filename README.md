# GodGrains Website

Complete Next.js e-commerce website for GodGrains teff products.

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation is in the `/README` folder:

- **[DEPLOYMENT.md](README/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - How to deploy the website
- **[SETUP_TASKS.md](README/SETUP_TASKS.md)** - Required configuration tasks
- **[FILE_LOCATIONS.md](README/FILE_LOCATIONS.md)** - Where to find and update content

## Quick Start

1. Read `README/DEPLOYMENT.md` for deployment instructions
2. Complete tasks in `README/SETUP_TASKS.md` before launching
3. Use `README/FILE_LOCATIONS.md` for future content updates

## 🎯 Why This Approach is Best

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Clean root directory
- ✅ All documentation in one organized place
- ✅ Still has README.md in root (convention)
- ✅ Root README acts as navigation/table of contents
- ✅ Professional structure

**What you need to do:**
1. Create `/README` folder in root
2. Put your three detailed docs inside with simpler names (DEPLOYMENT.md, SETUP_TASKS.md, FILE_LOCATIONS.md)
3. Create simple README.md in root as pointer

## 📧 Update Your Email

**Change this line in your email:**

**Before:**
```
Deployment instructions included (README file)
```

**After:**
```
Complete documentation in /README folder:
- DEPLOYMENT.md - How to deploy
- SETUP_TASKS.md - What to configure  
- FILE_LOCATIONS.md - Where everything is
```

---

## 🗂️ Alternative: Everything in Folder (Also Fine)

If you prefer, you CAN just put everything in `/README` folder with NO root README.md:

**Structure:**
```
/README/
  ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
  ├── SETUP_TASKS.md
  └── FILE_LOCATIONS.md
```

**Just update your email to say:**
```
DOCUMENTATION:
All instructions are in the /README folder:
- Open the /README folder
- Start with DEPLOYMENT.md
- Then read SETUP_TASKS.md
- Use FILE_LOCATIONS.md for future updates
